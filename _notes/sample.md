# Introduction to Paper Design

This is a sample note to demonstrate the **paper-like** design. It should feel comfortable to read, like a well-typeset book or a clean sheet of paper.

## Features

- **Typography**: Uses *Merriweather* for body text and *Lato* for headings.
- **Layout**: Centered content with optimal line length.
- **Code**: Clean code blocks.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Paper World!")
```
