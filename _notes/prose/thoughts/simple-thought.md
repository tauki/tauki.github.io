This is a simple thought, presented in the new **Prose** layout.

It is designed for distraction-free reading. No table of contents, no complex sidebars. Just the text, centered and focused.

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

The font size is slightly larger to encourage reading flow. It's perfect for essays, reflections, or short updates where the content is the only thing that matters.

You can still use standard Markdown features:

*   Lists
*   **Bold** and *Italic*
*   [Links](/)

But the focus remains on the words.
