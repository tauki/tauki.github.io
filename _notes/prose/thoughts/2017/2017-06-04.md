How can I forget the white gown? As white as it could be, as soul as it could be. For a little contiguity, I kissed the wall with my pale skin. Or an overlap. You're my flower full of canvas. How many times I have to go to the past and kill myself over and over again? I'm just a projection after all. The white gown still haunts me in my sleep. I can still remember it, stained, how do you get it off? They told me to look for you after everything was over and I waited for every sunrise. What is a dream and what is a reality? I planted a sunflower above the grave, the epitaph remained unformulated.
