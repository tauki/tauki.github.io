Confined within four walls like a coffin. When the tears fell out of my eyes, I cried. The world filled with the smell of a fresh rose which is slowly dying. When I close my eyes, why can I still see you light up with a beautiful smile? Memories are like a painting, a memoir of a burning sorrow. In the split moment, I lived a thousand lives. In between sometimes, I feel the warmth in my hands. The snow was taking on a red tint. Where do I lie down? I saw me falling into the red velvet. Existence is a rarity. Do you remember the time when you were nothing but the sound? We shook hands, we had a deal that we'd outlive everything. In an evening like this over a cup of tea. I saw you walking down a street. I ran toward you, with every ounce of spirit I had left in me, I screamed out your name and I watched my words fading before hitting you. I saw seasons passing by before my eyes. Green to orange, orange to yellow, yellow to black, black to white. Everything washed away by the rain. I'm just a stone, waiting for the world to circle back to the same place again. But nothing comes to the same place twice. Before going back to sleep again, what is this warmth do I feel?
