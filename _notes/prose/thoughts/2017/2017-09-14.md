You came to me at night but I was sleeping and you were like an angel in my dream. You sprinkled your love dust on me and I wanted to wake up and embrace you really tight. A soft bite on your neck and the thick and salty taste in my mouth. Your blood spill on my white blanket left the mark of your presence and will always haunt me. And hunt me. I was hunted down like a boar, I was just a killer, I was just a pig, I was just a dog, I was just a tiger, I was just a fox. Yes, I killed more people than there's finger in my hand. I was born a killer. But this is what I was, I was a person who enjoyed killing people. I was just a killer, I was not a cattle. I was not a lone wolf. I wanted to be loved. Where's my love? No one ever loved me. What's my dream? In my dream, I'm home and I'm a little kid. And I still love killing people. Nothing made me happier. I am a killer and I want to say it out loud! And you don't get to kill me.
