Have you forgotten the sweet songs of the ancient bay? They were much rich in life and you could really dance to them. All the unpurified epitomes revolving our heads towards our toes like a bazooka dyeing our noses with the utter yellowish blue tin-foiled choirs. You tried dancing but you broke your nose tripping on your smelly feet. Ick, I hate your hand molded in a rat stewed with tomatoes and green chiles. Sitting here in the fancy part of the table with a silver spoon enjoying the exquisite palate, I merely have time to look at you a disgusting discharge. The more time I stay the more I keep basking in the sun. Surprisingly when you're in the core of the sun, there's not that much light left, you cannot see the nuclear fusion, soon before you drag me around, drag me in and, fuse me with your inner existence. I'm the magician, with a wave of the tip of my finger, I can turn you into a chicken.
