I forgot how my soul used to look like at the beginning, but presuming, not as ugly as it seems from down under the pile of chains. I don't remember anything, I wanted to at first, but now I just want to give up and stop surviving for now. I had a dream, to be free again. I had a dream of a world, where I could breath freely without the weight pulling me down. I had a dream where I would be able to run, feel the fresh wind through my hair, run as fast as I can, run until my lungs were full. Now, I just can look back at times. It's been a while the pile started consuming me, slowly, much similar to a slow killing poison. It'd be easier if I just give up. No one will hear the scream through all this pile anyway. No way to break the chains anymore, it already made my soul corrupted and consumed more than half of it. With what's left of it, not even a ounce of light that can show me the path anymore. It works much better if I let it drag me around. Time for confronting. Time for comforting. I still dream to be free again, buried within me there somewhere. I still can hear the music, I can feel it fading away. Nothing compared to the sereneness of the music that already started to welcome me to my funereal.
