Can you move like a snake? Neither can I. The compendium moment, when you are in a confrontation with the snake, it might have a blank look and overly slimy tongue. But how do you know? While it gaze at you with this hypnotizingly cold eyes, you have nowhere to hide. You run to nowhere because you'd prefer not to get guzzled by the snake, no; rather you'd much prefer to devour it for yourself. Because you're suddenly feeling this urgency, this sudden strain, this crave or, you'd rather say, you are going through this strong inclination. To devour a snake, do you need to become one first? You like your newly found self, you're happy. You laugh like a mad man. You laugh like a mad-man in a mad world with the red-blue eyes! You laugh for a long time because you have all the time now. Now you're the snake, and the snake is you. You light up with the newly found superiority. How long has it been? While running to the snake, you feel this sadistic lust building inside you, motivating you to run faster. The ground started to move already, increasing the distance. You laugh, because you don't know how real is any reality. Before closing those eyes of yours, in between the mist of existence, you see yourself loosing yourself.
