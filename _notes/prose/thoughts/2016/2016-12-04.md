Don't you just want to kill everyone and go to your mind palace for eternity? Where you can run free, dive into the ocean, fly with the untamed birds. Everything looks real, feels real when you touch. Everything looks familiar when you're in it. Undisturbed. Which reality is reality? Where do you put everything enclosed for later? Everything for tomorrow and today for eternity. Don't you feel tired that you have to move your mouth Every-time you want to talk to someone? Which is easier? Which is the destination? Is it not frustrating that everything is real and fake at the same time to the sane mind? And at the same time, sane mind feels so; unreal. Un-sane mind domesticated under the Sanity. Sanity is the law making organization. Sanity is like a goat farm. Insanity is the goat. One day, just one day, when time is irrelevant; one could lay down on a grassland, near a beautiful stream, listening to the tranquilizing sound; see the stars move.
