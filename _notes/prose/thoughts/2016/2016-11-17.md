Suddenly I summon thee, the ghost of my ancient past. I channel myself to thee; I give my life to you so that you can see from where you started to fade away. You became one with the nature, you gave up everything in creating me and now I'll do the same for you. Somewhere in the midst of me, I know you still lie, waiting to be awakened once again. Your hibernation needs to come to an end, because once again everything needs you, to guide through. My body floats through undestined, shining brighter than ever now, it's time for you to come back. Walk toward the light, the preparations are done. Thousands and thousands are waiting for you to arrive. Come, come soon to me.
