A green field, empty but serenity. Empty, but serenity. Memories, emotions. But there's just, something missing. Yet, you let the vibrations completely consume you and, take you to a free fall to the point of infinity. You get to a point, where if you step forward, you know there's no coming back, one last step. You hear someone knocking, but when you open the door, there's no one and, nothing. You look back and you realize, this is everything that you ever wanted.﻿ Existing is always relative.﻿ You see the souls dancing, you see the pool, full of colors, you take a deep breath, you smile, and you dive into the pool. Your soul is no longer just a ball of cold fire. Just as the fire rises, all in the dark is revealed. Do you still remember the time when you were nothing but the sound?

I'm going back to the carousel.
