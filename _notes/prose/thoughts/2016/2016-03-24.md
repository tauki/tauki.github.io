For everything that's wrong with this world. When the night is darker, I can always turn to the lake, behind that most beautiful flower you'll ever see. You can almost smell the sweet scent from miles apart, from behind the hills, where the Hyena died cruelly. The smell of it's rotten flesh was made tolerable by the scent. But not as tolerable as it's calm white eyes, white like a clean blue sky. The scent kept the vultures away. Come to mo'ma, you're now home.
