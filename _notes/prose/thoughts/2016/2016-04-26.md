She danced beautifully while the full moon shone between her steps. She used the purest of the water as her cloths. You could see her cloths shine up while she dance. She would leave a trace of her steps so you could follow. While she danced, you could see her presence sprinkled around and get so bright that it'd take form like beautiful rose petals. In between the petals, she'd shine bright and take the form of a pure corolla. Even while she's not there, if you've seen her dance even once, when you close your eyes, you could feel her presence, still dancing. Her long straight brown hair, the pure white ribbon that was always bigger than her hair would gently wave you welcome. While she danced, the traces would shine up. It was forbidden to disturb her dance. It was forbidden to get close to her while she was in her trance. Even though, to get to her, you'd have to climb mountains, cross rivers and the flower garden. The flower garden was the most dangerous, from a distance it looked like a beautiful white dragon guarding her. She shouldn't be awaken. For an instant, you'll loser her behind the pillars. Everything around her is of pure white. The darkest sky being the only exception.
