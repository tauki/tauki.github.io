How many existence you've been through and how many are still waiting? The universe is perhaps surreal. The scratch on her back won't take that long to omit completely. Slowly, when the time runs slower. Perhaps the universe is just irrational juxtaposition of images. Who keeps the track of time? Just floating inside this vibration of existing. Being completely unaware. They shall dance with deadly synchrony. The king, the king is looking. And, they shan't stop until the time takes a break. Maybe the king won't know, one time when he shook his head, his nose wobbled and some time came out. I've never seen him more embarrassed. In fact, I've never seen him embarrassed at all, I'm used to the cruel side of his face. Do you not want to break out of the barrier to see what's on the other side? Shall you? It might be just a naked version of you. The muse, she speaks through me, I'm but a humble vessel.
