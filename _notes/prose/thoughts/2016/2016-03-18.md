Riddled, so many unanswered questions, so many disputed questions. Free fall to the point of infinity. Surrounded by riddles. Sometimes it's just emptiness. The pressure builds, sometimes the sensation makes me wonder, what if I could just touch the veins, it wouldn't even matter. But, I am without hands.
