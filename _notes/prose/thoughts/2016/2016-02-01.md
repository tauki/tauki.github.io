Looking at the projection on the mirror, when you realize, the abstract is of everything you hate, constructed toward the very core. When you realize, the reason it's so easy to go through the colors, is because, yours is so much similar, but you just don't want to admit it. You can't run away from it, no matter how hard you try. Every single vibration around it is projecting the colors you want to run away from. It's really frustrating how hard you try to cover it with fake colors you wear upon it. Everything you want to create is a hollow, so that it's easier to start painting all over again, from the beginning. But you just can't go back. You want the cold breeze to wipe everything out. You go to sleep because you just want to wake up to a new reality where color looks different.
