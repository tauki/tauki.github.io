Calm, slowly a drop of blood traveling its way from the knife, hit the ground. Everything is slipping away like a glimpse of an eye. A lifespan is not even like a second to the universe, nothing will matter. A lifespan is as small as the few seconds of flash before the eyes before it ends. Why must it always end the same? Don't you think it's cruel? Not caring is cruel or it's more logical? Everything spinning like a turtle thrown on a marble floor, on it's back. Every moment is every life and every life is just another interstellar overdrive. Insignificant blood drop and the insignificant overdrives. Insignificant to who's not looking. Insignificant yet stunning, to everyone else. My legs might be a horn to me, but it might be a flute to someone else. My uninspiring walk to the kill might appear as a matter of interest. As the flashes go by, blood-soaked grasped fist be seen blooming like a nature's own paradise. How red the blood is, red like the color of blood.
