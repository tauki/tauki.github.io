Do you see the greenish monstrous hand, trying to rip off your chest and trying to come out. Or do you see yourself becoming the monster. Is it really inside you or, you choose to let it thrive inside you. Your little secret. Is it really taking over your place and yourself, or you're choosing it to come out. You feel more comfortable being the monster. It's easy to feel nothing. It's easy to observe, it's easy to prey. It's easy to devour the vibrations and let the monster be held contempt. Did you ever try to look at it's face? You see nothing. Now, look from a mirror.

"Oh, Requiem of a dream!"
