# Laughter


The road to the happiness  
The earth never stops spinning  
But still, nothing returns to a same place twice.  
  
In a meadow  
In between a flock of yellow unknown flowers  
I can see the blue sky upon me,  
I can see the clouds looking right at me  
Cloud shaped of a blue sphere  
  
Its been 98 days, since I saw the last being  
even though I can always feel the presence near me  
although my eyes and ears are shut down, my hands are tied up  
inside my soul I'm always free  
and before the day comes, they will only hear me laughing.  
  
The way how a lizard can change it’s color to hide its existence  
I’ll always be found in the meadow,  
looking at the sky.
