The sound of being alive, do you pay much attention to it? The rhythmic sound. Yes you're still alive. Can you take a moment and listen to it? just for a moment. Takes you back to the time when existence did not matter. When the universe was never here. Can you feel the sound? Can you taste the color? Letting you know that you're alive, every moment. Don't die kid. Don't die yet. Dying can be uncertain, but you'll only die when you really wish to. Look up to the sky, can you see the stars? blinking. Do you know how big they are actually? Yet they appear so little to you. The universe is so big, you haven't been 'alive' for even a thousandth of a second. Do you remember the time when you were nothing other than just the sound?
