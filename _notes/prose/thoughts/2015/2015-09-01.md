I saw, a glimpse. In the compendious moment, I was aware of the subsequent. Under the spotlight, there you stand. But, before there could be a next glance, the essence dissipated, making me aware of what I can touch was precious. The glitters, like stars, feels like the small fire particles. Consuming every cells of my body and drenching me away as it proceeds. It looks so little, I could just hold it in my hands. Maybe it has an origin. But something is denying the existence of everything that existed between the small moment. But as you proceed to be there and, as soon as you reach there, everything that it stands for is falsified. But still you can see the void it left behind. The access is only permitted to you, but there is nothing other than that empty black region under the still bold spotlight.
