Emptiness. We are time-traveling every-time we look into our past. A glimpse of us from a dimension where we might not exist anymore. The true kind of emptiness, have we ever felt? The dimension, is it empty? The center of a black hole, a pin-point of emptiness? The little wooden horse in a carousel, is empty when not a child is sitting there? How can someone want to get back from something where nothing exists. Existence. What is this, existing? Existence of emptiness, between two wave of a vibration that, consumed every thought. Origin, time emergent.
