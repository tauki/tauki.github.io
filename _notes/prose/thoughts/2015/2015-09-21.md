One other reason is, I enjoyed the fantasy. When the container is not enough to hold onto the essence and the radiation starts to kill. Maybe someday the reality will shatter like a piece of glass that used to project only my face into itself because, it was so close near me, it could never get to see the existence of anything other than the existence I make into the identity. Maybe the reality behind the glass is arbitrary to my existence or the reality itself is arbitrary. Or, the reality is just layers of glasses that keeps on projecting my face one by one and, one onto another. If I look around, I can't find a strong enough log so I can break through the glasses and see the end. I only have the face. But it bleeds if I try to break through a reality glass and, it gets more and more scary in every attempt, to look at, but more and more clearer, as it starts to peel off the skins, uncovering the reality hidden underneath. It's more glasses.
