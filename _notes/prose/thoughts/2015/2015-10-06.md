Oh, the skies, tumbling from your eyes. There are means of influence other than violence. But violence is what you understand. How an influence can reconstruct the whole idea of existing. When you look at her, do you see relieveness, I see fear in her eyes, trembling through her cheeks. Was it good to see me? You can trust me, you know. Sometimes the influence can be strong enough to completely consume your existence and present you with a resurrection. When you see him consuming you with such appease, do you feel fulfilled? It's good to finally hold a meaning. It's good to finally get to define. Influence is like a blow, but a blow can be sometimes strong enough to completely re-route or even end. When you look at the existence, do you see the art? Did you construct an artistic definition for every floating projections? When an influence can be strong enough that your existence will burst and change. Like a Phoenix. Breaking through the core of you. I feel the core crushing. The existence is fading, for the renascence. Someday, perhaps, the cup will come together. The becoming. How many existence you've been through and how many are still waiting? When life becomes maddeningly polite, think about your, the true existence. This is your design.
