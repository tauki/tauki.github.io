I saw them live, I saw them play, I saw them holding hands siting next to each other when its raining. The look on their face had the perfect expression of happiness. Sometimes I didn't know either to close my eyes or not to. Because I was not aware of if their existence is only in me or not, if they are real or just my imagination. I was afraid, to move, I did not want it to change. Because when I look at them, I see a portion of myself that I buried long ago. Because when I look at them, I see myself from a distinct past. Sometimes, a single goodbye is not enough to let go. (about two kids in a playground)
