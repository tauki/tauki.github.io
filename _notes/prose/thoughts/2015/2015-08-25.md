There's this expression, on which a great deal of hypothesis is relied on. It's the cat in a box. We don't get to see if the cat is dead or alive, or just siting around or actually doing something unless we lift the cover up. What if we don't lift the cover up and let the cat live inside that rectangular box for infinity amount of time? Or how about, small amount of time we undergo can mean infinity to the cat. Provide the cat with books, so it can self-educate itself, provide it with proper ventilation so it can breath properly and, food and water so it doesn't die out of thirst or severe deficiency in caloric energy intake. And so the cat doesn't feel empty, doesn't feel alone, provide it with a portal so it can communicate with other cats from outside the box and maybe even let it have visitors, but forbid its existence of physical self outside the box. Let it be completely aware, completely conscious of whats going on everywhere. The whole life, inside a box, who even existed to some other cat from outside, but never existed anywhere but the box and just the cat and the obtained knowledge alone.
