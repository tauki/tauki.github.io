When you feel the cold wall against your spine, you have nowhere to go, nowhere to be other than this place, if you could just get out of it this one time. When you're trapped inside your life, you just want to break through. But when you look into your reflection, when you realize you've been living the same life, every-life!

Morse code in video is apparently:

“It doesn’t matter what I say”

“The only thing that matters is how you feel”

“Understanding that the words are irrelevant is of great importance” 

“What feelings do you have”
