The person had the cognitive of, as you can define someone who is a bit proud. The sensation he gets while being one of the most intellectually advanced in a group is something he made to be one of the major instinct. Even though he knew how dark a nightmare can be, he forcefully pushes himself to live in one every time he sleeps and wishes to stay there the longest. A night is really dark, not because of the absence of the sun light, but it is when all the souls collide, trying to become one and, trying to consume everything in between. This is so fascinating yet so fearful at the same time how, if someone changes between reality, no matter how much that person wishes to, even if there is a path, no footstep has been drown upon it yet. Interpretation of living in between. Words are tricky. Like, how hard it can be to live inside the stone age moments. Do you believe it's possible to grow wings just because you want to fly? The power of questioning 'why' and 'how' is the reason we get to define everything by our point of view.
