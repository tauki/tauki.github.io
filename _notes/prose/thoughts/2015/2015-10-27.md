Constructing a vibration, more appropriately, a perfect vibration is not easy. The unique string is unknown to you, while you are stuck inside your box of existence. You are not born free and you will never be. You'll always be trapped inside your box. Strings are your play toys. It takes time to construct a string. But time is relative and inside the box time doesn't matter, because the existence of time is upon you. While you play with your strings, you break your strings, you reconstruct your strings, you recreate strings, you learn new strings every time. It's not easy to remember every bit of every string all together. Strings are ultimately vibrations. You make standard vibrations, you look for patterns. You make your strings big and powerful enough to hit other boxes you're not aware of, unwillingly, the vibration is even unknown to the kids inside those box. Sometimes, even distorted. Sometimes even more perfect. But you are the kid, who's always playing. And who's always trapped inside the box with nothing else to do without playing. You wish you were free. Playing makes so much sense to you. Sometimes you can only make a hole in your box not big enough for you to get out. You dream of a time, when you will be free.
