I die every night, I live inside a corpse. It doesn't feel that bad, when I die. I go to a place that has it's own reality. When I leave my corpse to decompose, I go to a place where reality is different. Reality is relative my friend, you don't have to be alive to be considered alive. But every-time, I return to the same constant reality before my corpse has been decomposed properly. I live inside that half-rotten mirror image of myself in the relative reality. This universe is like a disk. Round and shiny, truly magnificent. It has all the information of everything that's been taking place inside of itself. I was brought to a reality when I saw, my horse in the round carousel, just like an universe. looking at me. It wanted me to kill it. It wanted me to feast on its raw meat and shower with its blood. I was looking at it quizzaciously. Why? because from my reality, I wanted it to suffer, because otherwise, it wouldn't have proper meaning, a proper art. It would be just a murder. A grand feast requires its proper justification according to the reality of itself. A piece of torn cloth so you can investigate its vérité. A hapax legomenon.
