Everything is just an illusion. Time is from the children's storybook. But still, we exist, for a mere insignificant part of a second. For an uncertain reason, we pay a hefty price to exist, living a life that has already been lived. Amongst the infinite number of reality, we use all our power to tune into this reality. And all our power is just enough for a meaningless peek. Then why do we choose to do it? That's a mystery that remains unsolved. When we try to see who we are, we just get to see those who guard the door that hides us, and we assume that they are us. No matter how many times we try to reach ourselves, for some reason that's somewhere even we don't want to go. Those walls that hide us are our own creation; feels like all the answers can be found behind the door. But we are just scared. Thus begins our eternal solitary behind the wall. An eternity that sums up to just a mere insignificant part of a second.
