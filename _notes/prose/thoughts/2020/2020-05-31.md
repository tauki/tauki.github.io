This is the only place where I exist and nowhere else. While everything else in the universe is stationary, life moves on. The hands become wrinkly and the legs get weary and the life's journey is what it is. Unaware of where we exist and what everything is we look for meaning and explanation. We forget where our home is, and we're unaware when we even left. Thus trying to get back, we start a journey that takes a lifetime in search for it. We float in a non-existent surface which feels just as real as life itself. The universe itself is my mind's creation and will stop existing when I die.
