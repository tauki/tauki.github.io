The world is a strange place. Nothing you see is there, and everyone you can see is yourself from a different time. The time is I, and the time is every step I take and every twitch in my eye. As I, am everything, and I am everyone who lived, and everyone to come. I am the flower in your garden, and I am you when you water it. I am a sailor, and I am the boat. I am a solid box and my every shape and every form are confined within it, separated by time to help me move easily as time is just standing still and everyone I see is just interlocked with time and stuck in a moment forever, as time, does not exist. If I am everyone, then who is real? As I am just a reality perception and I am just a traveller who travelled every cosmos and beyond. This is the prophecy, that one day, I'd have lived every corner of the box and that is when everything will cease to exist. As I am just one box in an infinitely vast sea of boxes and every box is me. With my demise brings the destruction of reality and there is nothing anyone can do about it. For now, we submerge ourselves to the dance and we swirl and we keep going round and round around everything and everyone as this is the last time anyone will ever dance. And we play god, as everything is I.
