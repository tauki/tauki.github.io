Alas, this is where it ends. With no other option, there is merely one thing that can be done. There is no dignity in dying; death is not a thing to be proud of. There is not a dignifying or glorifying way to depart. I have been called a lot of names throughout my life. I have been the embodiment of the god of death. In these last few moments, time has seemed to slow down. As I run towards the inevitable, every step I take expands to a lifetime. It appears as if the universe itself came to witness the moment. I know what is about to happen because this is the path I brew for myself. Alas, I am just a human like everyone else. And now, this is the moment which will create a ripple in the universe strong enough to tear everything in its sight.
