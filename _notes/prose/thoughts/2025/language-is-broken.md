Language is inherently broken. It is a poor medium of communication. Thoughts are unclear. They come in waves. We waste so much time trying to wrap them in syntax, in words that only barely point at what we mean. When you try to explain the color to a blind man, when you try to explain the sound a glass makes to someone who’s never heard, when you try to explain your language to a bird, when you try to explain your red to me, language falls apart.

Emotions are abstract; they don’t come with names. We spend a lot of energy moulding it into a shape, and to put it into color, just to get close to understanding what we’re feeling. And even then, it’s blurry. Vague. Always almost.

When does time and consciousness converge? Is time even real? We live on a rock, and we share the space with a lot of conscious and unconscious life, hurling through an almost empty void, pretending we know what’s going on. We could be slingshotted deep into space in every direction, and each of us would be consumed by our own universe, like a baseball player catching a ball. The past, the present, and the future might all exist in the same plane and happening at the same time. Then how is the consciousness travelling through time?

It is so complicated to get your thoughts out, painters die while painting, musicians die mid-composing, writers sit in front of empty pages as their hair turns white and their hands wrinkle, trying to say something they can’t say.

The universe is inherently simple. Just things, in space, drifting towards entropy, while once in a while someone blows a bubble. But what are things? When we lie down on a grass bed, what is it?

And if you slow down the universe and if everything disappears for a second, does consciousness persist?
