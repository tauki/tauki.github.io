The regular neighbourhood computer magician. Wants to be a nomad engineer who travels the world and helps build products to solve problems. Often seen buried in a book or spaced out to a different universe. Has an interest in art and likes to experience the synergy that brings everything together. Writes and cooks as a hobby, and tries to see the pattern that defines everything. Likes experimenting and learning new things. Artificial Intelligence, Philosophy, psychology, distributed systems, system architecture & orchestration, are among the many other things that interest him. Has pet birds. Loves nature.

I believe in what Freeman Dyson once said, that [science is a craft industry](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.280.5366.1014), and to be a good artisan, one needs patience and eagerness to learn, that's what I root for.

> Sometimes, science is more art than science. A lot of people don't get that. -Rick Sanchez

> “… trees are made of Air, primarily. When they are burned, they go back to Air, and in the flaming heat is released the flaming heat of the sun which was bound in to convert the air into tree. And in the ash is the small remnant of the part which did not come from Air, that came from the solid earth, instead.” -Richard Feynman 

> “Space is really big. You won’t believe how vastly hugely mind-boggling big it is. I mean, you may think it is a long way down the road to the chemist, but that’s just peanuts to space.” -Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy
