# About Me

Hi, I'm **Tauki Tahmid**.

I am a **Backend Engineer** based in **Oslo, Norway**, specializing in **Go** and **Distributed Systems**. Currently, I am working at **Arker**, empowering the AEC industry to confidently manage and leverage data.

I aspire to be a nomad engineer who travels the world and helps build products to solve real-world problems. I am often seen buried in a book or spaced out to a different universe, always trying to see the pattern that defines everything.

I enjoy experimenting and learning new things. Writing and cooking are my hobbies, and I love experiencing the synergy that brings everything together.

### Interests

My interests span across technology, art, and the human experience:

*   **Technology**: Distributed Systems, System Architecture & Optimization, Artificial Intelligence.
*   **Humanities**: Philosophy, Psychology, Art.
*   **Personal**: Nature, my pet birds.

> "I believe in what Feynman once said, that science is a craft industry, and to be a good artisan, one needs patience and eagerness to learn, that's what I wait for."
