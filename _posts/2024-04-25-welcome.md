Welcome to my new blog! This is a sample post to demonstrate how blog posts will look.

## Writing in Markdown

You can write your blog posts in Markdown, which is similar to LaTeX in terms of readability. Here's an example of some formatting:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `code snippets`

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Links

You can add [links](https://example.com) to other websites.

### Images

That's it for now! More posts coming soon.
